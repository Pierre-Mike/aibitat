- **Automated reply with loop prevention.** Chats are kept alive until the
  assistant interrupts the conversation.
- **Group chats.** Agents chat with multiple other agents at the same time as if
  they were in a Whatsapp group. The next agent to reply is chosen based on the
  conversation and predicted most likely to reply.
